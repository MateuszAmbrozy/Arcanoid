## Breakout Game with SFML and Box2D
This project is a Breakout game built with C++ using SFML and Box2D libraries. The game features object-oriented programming concepts such as polymorphism, abstract classes, namespaces, and inheritance. Box2D is used for collision detection and physics simulation.

The game includes animations and a menu system with multiple windows including an editor, level selection, game, and modifications. Players can choose from different levels and adjust the window size and scaling. Additionally, players can select different balls, paddles, backgrounds, and use sliders to adjust the sound volume.
