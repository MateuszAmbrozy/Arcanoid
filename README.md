This project is a Breakout game built with C++ using SFML and Box2D libraries. <br>
The game features object-oriented programming concepts such as polymorphism, <br>
abstract classes, namespaces, and inheritance. Box2D is used for collision detection and physics simulation.<br>

The game includes animations and a menu system with multiple windows including an editor,<br>
level selection, game, and modifications. Players can choose from different levels and adjust the window size and scaling.<br>
Additionally, players can select different balls, paddles, backgrounds, and use sliders to adjust the sound volume.<br>
